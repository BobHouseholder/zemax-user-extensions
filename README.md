# Zemax OpticStudio User Extensions

ZOS-API user extensions for Ansys Zemax OpticStudio, built and validated against
OpticStudio 2026 R1.01. Each extension is a self-contained C# (.NET Framework 4.8)
console application. Compiled executables deploy to `{Zemax Data}\ZOS-API\Extensions\`
and appear under **Programming > User Extensions** in the OpticStudio ribbon; they can
also be run from a shell against a session waiting in
**Programming > Interactive Extension** mode.

## Extensions

### EquivalentGlassFinder

Solves the community feature request
["Equivalent Glass" Feature Proposal](https://community.zemax.com/got-a-question-7/equivalent-glass-feature-proposal-881):
for every glass in the loaded system it finds the closest available material by
weighted (nd, vd, dPgF) distance, reports ranked candidates, applies the best match,
and prints before/after performance (EFFL, merit function, RMS spot per field).
By default it replaces only obsolete glasses from the catalogs in use; pass
`-catalog NAME` to convert an entire design to another vendor's nearest equivalents.

Options: `-catalog NAME`, `-includeObsolete`, `-report`, `-reopt`, `-save`,
`-top N`, `-wnd/-wvd/-wpgf` (distance weights).

### ReverseSystem

Reverses any refractive sequential system in place - including systems with
coordinate breaks and negative-thickness virtual propagation, which the built-in
Reverse Elements tool cannot handle (see community threads
[How to flip the whole optical system](https://community.zemax.com/got-a-question-7/how-to-flip-the-whole-optical-system-1367),
[Reverse elements erases materials](https://community.zemax.com/got-a-question-7/reverse-elements-erases-materials-3682)).

The reversed system is derived as the mirror image traversed backwards
(`rev(op) = M.op^-1.M`): radii and polynomial sag terms negate, gaps reverse order
keeping their signs, materials ride with their gaps, and coordinate breaks negate
decenter X/Y and tilt-Z, keep tilt X/Y, and flip the order flag. Additionally:

- all solves/pickups are frozen to their values first so they cannot corrupt the rewrite
- surface apertures travel with their surfaces
- the system aperture converts to Float By Stop Size with the physical stop
  semi-diameter preserved (paraxial marginal at the primary wavelength), so the
  reversed trace is the same physical bundle
- conjugate states swap for a true reversal: real marginal ray fans (x and y,
  analysed separately with astigmatism detection) classify the original image space
  as collimated or converging, and the reversed object/image spaces and the
  afocal-image-space flag are set to match
- reflective systems, unsupported surface types, and multi-configuration systems
  with surface-referencing MCE operands are refused with explicit messages rather
  than silently corrupted

Options: `-save`, `-keepconj`, `-refocus`, `-rayaim`, `-keepaperture`,
`-georeport`, `-file <path>` (headless batch mode), `-out <path>`.

Validated by exact double-reversal identity (LDE prescription and RMS spot values
restore digit-for-digit) on 8+ OpticStudio sample systems, plus numeric global-
geometry mirror-congruence checks via `-georeport`.

## Building

Requires the .NET SDK and an OpticStudio installation. `ZemaxPaths.props` (in the
sibling `repo/` clone, or create your own) points `ZEMAX_ROOT` at the install
directory; the ZOSAPI assemblies are referenced with `Private=false` and resolved
at runtime by `ZOSAPI_NetHelper`.

```
dotnet build extensions\ReverseSystem\ReverseSystem.csproj --configuration Release
dotnet build extensions\EquivalentGlassFinder\EquivalentGlassFinder.csproj --configuration Release
```

Copy the built `.exe` files to `{Zemax Data}\ZOS-API\Extensions\`.
